But, seriously, where are they? One way of trying to answer this is to answer:
* What approaches have really smart people (Minsky, Winston, Aaronson, Wolfram, Brooks, etc...) taken to try to formulate/understand/answer the question of building smart robots? 
* Why did they choose that approach? 
* What are the benefits / drawbacks of that approach?
* Has their approach changed over the years? Why?
* How long do they think it will take them that direction to pan out with a yes/no?
* What critisms have been leveled against their approach?
